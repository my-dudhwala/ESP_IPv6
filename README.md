# ESP_IPv6
I am working(Actually trying) to connect ESP32 or ESP8266 with my IPv6 router. This repo is made to update my work. I'm sharing this repo where I have to update status of my work, I am open to modify this document from anyone. And I am open to collaborate on this until the project works successfully.
